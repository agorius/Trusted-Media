# Trusted Media: Crowd-Sourced Truth from Cellphones

An open-source solution to combat fake news by cryptographically signing photos and videos at capture using smartphone secure boot. No patents, no profit—just a shared truth for humanity. Born from a collaboration with Grok (xAI) on Feb 20, 2025.

## The Problem
Fake media fractures reality—20 “truths” for one event, fueled by pundits and doctored pixels. Legacy news twists facts into outrage bait. We’re stuck in loops of division when we need unity.

## The Solution
Turn every cellphone into a truth machine:
- **Secure Signing**: Leverage Android/iOS trusted boot to hash raw media (SHA-256) and sign it with user + OS keys (via TEE/Secure Enclave).
- **Verifiable Output**: Embed signatures in metadata. Anyone can validate against public keys—no edits, no fakes.
- **Crowd-Sourced Power**: Anyone can capture and share trusted media. News outlets license it; commentators argue over it. Facts stay free.

## Why It Matters
- Restores a common baseline—real events, not spin.
- Open and free—built by us, for us, no gatekeepers.
- Scales with billions of phones already in pockets.

## Get Involved
This is raw—help us make it real:
- **Devs**: Prototype a signing camera app (Android/iOS).
- **Crypto Nerds**: Refine key management, hash efficiency.
- **Thinkers**: Poke holes, suggest use cases (protests, disasters).
- **X Crew**: Spread it—anti-establishment truth starts here.

Fork it, file issues, PR your ideas. No one owns this—it’s ours.
